description: Update Laravel PHP translation files by fixing missing or empty translations in lang/**/*.php. Use when UI copy changes, new keys are added, or locale files are out of sync. Trigger whenever translation keys, lang files, i18n, or __() / @lang() strings are mentioned.

# Translations Updater

This skill keeps Laravel translation files consistent and complete.

## Key conventions

This project uses **translations keys** in JSON files.

## When to use this Skill

- New UI text or translation keys were introduced
- Modules, pages, or components added new strings
- PHP translation files contain empty or missing values
- Locale files are out of sync with the codebase
- A supported language is added or removed

## Voice and tense per locale for logs

When we are translating logs, match the convention for each language:

| Locale | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `en` | Simple past, active | "Created an account" |
| `fr_FR` | Passé composé, actif | "A créé un compte" |
| `de` | Perfekt, active (Hat + Partizip) | "Hat ein Konto erstellt" |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Regenerate locale files

1. Run the locale generation command:
   ```bash
   composer beaver:locale
   ```
2. Confirm the command completes successfully before making any edits.

### Step 2: Identify missing or empty translations

- For each new entry in the `en.json` file, check all other locale files of the project and fix any missing or empty translations.
- **Do not remove keys** unless they are confirmed unused.
- **For empty or invalid values** — replace with an appropriate human-readable translation.
- **Preserve placeholders exactly** — do not alter tokens like `:name`, `:count`, `:seconds`, `{value}`.
- **Preserve embedded HTML or Markdown** — structure must be identical across locales.
- **Consistency rules:**
   - Same tense and tone as surrounding keys
   - Same terminology used elsewhere in the locale file
   - No informal register unless the file already uses it

### Step 3: Quality checks

1. No empty strings, null values, or `TODO` placeholders remain.
2. If a translation is uncertain, prefer literal and conservative wording.
3. Maintain existing key order unless the project explicitly requires sorting.
4. Run `bash scripts/check-translations.sh` after translation changes; it checks all PHP short-key language files and fails on empty strings.
